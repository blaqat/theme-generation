# Theme Generation Playground

This playground directory contains examples, test files, and sample themes for experimenting with the theme generation tool. It serves as a testing ground for developing, testing, and iterating on color themes for various applications and editors.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create/Edit Variables**: Modify `.toml` files in `edit-mode/`
2. **Test Generation**: Use sample templates to generate themes
3. **Validate**: Check generated themes against `test-code/` samples
4. **Compare**: Use `comparison/` directory to track changes
5. **Iterate**: Refine colors and test across different platforms

## Tips

- Use the `watch` command for live preview during theme development
- Test themes across multiple file types in `test-code/`
- Compare generated themes with originals in `test-themes/comparison/`
- Reference existing platform themes for color scheme inspiration
